# Neural Network Project

## Overview

This project is an implementation of a neural network with multiple hidden layers. It is designed to perform forward and backward propagation, allowing you to compute and analyze the output of a neural network.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate a basic neural network implementation and provide a starting point for further exploration and development of neural network models. You can use this code to understand the inner workings of a neural network, modify it for specific applications, or use it as a learning resource.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- Linux operating system (for `fork` and `pipe` functions)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neural-network-project.git

2. Compile the code using the C++ compiler:   

    ```bash
    g++ main.cpp -o neural_network
    
3. Run the executable:

     ```bash
    ./neural_network

## Project Structure
- `main.cpp`: The main source file containing the neural network implementation.
- `file.txt`: A configuration file used for input data.

## Usage   
The code simulates a neural network with multiple hidden layers. It performs forward propagation and computes the output of the neural network. You can review the code in `main.cpp` to understand the implementation details.
